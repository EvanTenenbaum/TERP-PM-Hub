# TERP PM Hub - Handoff Document

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Project**: TERP Product Management Hub  
**Repository**: EvanTenenbaum/TERP  
**Live URL**: https://3000-id66rf050m9nb550luy4d-1adeaea7.manusvm.computer

---

## Executive Summary

The TERP PM Hub is a **fully functional product management system** with AI-powered features for capturing, triaging, and managing product ideas, bugs, and improvements. The system integrates with GitHub and includes intelligent workflows for converting ideas into structured Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and implementation plans.

During this session, comprehensive E2E testing was conducted, resulting in **2 critical bug fixes** and the discovery of **4 additional bugs** that require attention. The core functionality is working well, and the system is ready for continued development and user testing.

---

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack

**Frontend**:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- TanStack Query (React Query) for data fetching
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- Vite for build tooling

**Backend**:
- Node.js with Express
- tRPC for type-safe API
- Drizzle ORM for database operations
- MySQL database

**AI Integration**:
- Manus Forge API (Gemini 2.5 Flash model)
- Hybrid LLM approach (free + paid models)
- **IMPORTANT**: Uses `BUILT_IN_FORGE_API_KEY` environment variable

**Authentication**:
- OAuth integration with Manus
- JWT-based session management
- Owner-only access (configured via `OWNER_OPEN_ID`)

---

## AI Credits & Authentication - CRITICAL INFORMATION

### Who Pays for AI Usage?

**The application currently uses YOUR (the project owner's) Manus credits for ALL AI operations**, regardless of who is logged in.

**How it works**:
1. The system uses the `BUILT_IN_FORGE_API_KEY` environment variable
2. This API key is automatically injected by Manus and tied to YOUR Manus account
3. Every AI operation (triage, PRD generation, queue analysis) charges YOUR credits
4. Even if another Manus user logs in, they use YOUR credits

**Location in code**:
- `server/_core/env.ts` - Reads `BUILT_IN_FORGE_API_KEY` from environment
- `server/_core/llm.ts` - Uses this key for all LLM API calls (line 319)

**Current behavior**: 
- ✅ Simple and works out of the box
- ❌ All costs go to project owner
- ❌ No per-user credit tracking
- ❌ No usage limits per user

**If you want users to use their own credits**, you would need to:
1. Modify authentication to capture each user's Manus API key
2. Store user API keys securely in the database
3. Pass the logged-in user's API key to LLM calls instead of `BUILT_IN_FORGE_API_KEY`
4. Add error handling for users without valid API keys

---

## Bugs Fixed During Session

### BUG #4: Search Functionality Missing ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: Medium  
**Impact**: Users couldn't filter features by search term

**Problem**: The Features page had a search input but no filtering logic was implemented.

**Solution**: Implemented filter logic in `client/src/pages/Features.tsx`:
- Filters by title, itemId, and description
- Case-insensitive search
- Works with status dropdown filter

**Files changed**: `client/src/pages/Features.tsx`

---

### BUG #5: Convert to PRD Timeout ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: Critical  
**Impact**: PRD generation would hang indefinitely, blocking workflow

**Problem**: LLM API calls in `generatePRDHybrid` had no timeout, causing infinite loading states when API was slow or unresponsive.

**Solution**: Added timeout and error handling in `server/_core/llm-smart.ts`:
- 30-second timeout for draft generation
- 30-second timeout for enhancement
- Try-catch error handling with detailed logging
- Proper error messages returned to frontend

**Files changed**: `server/_core/llm-smart.ts`

---

## Outstanding Bugs (Require Fixes)

### BUG #1: Sync Timestamp Shows Wrong Year ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Severity**: Critical  
**Impact**: Erodes user trust, shows "0 items" despite 75+ items in database

**Current behavior**: Dashboard shows "Last synced: 10/30/2025, 7:31:11 AM (0 items)"

**Issues**:
1. Year shows 2025 instead of 2024
2. Item count shows 0 despite 75 items in database
3. Timestamp doesn't update after new items created

**Likely cause**: 
- Hardcoded or incorrectly formatted date
- Item count query not matching actual data
- Missing React Query invalidation

**Recommended fix**:
1. Find sync timestamp component in Dashboard
2. Use proper date formatting (new Date().toLocaleString())
3. Query actual item count from database
4. Add React Query invalidation after mutations

---

### BUG #3: Dashboard Stats Don't Auto-Update ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Severity**: Medium  
**Impact**: Users must manually refresh to see updated counts

**Current behavior**: After creating new items via Quick Capture or other methods, the dashboard stat cards (Features: 63, Ideas: 6, Bugs: 2, Total: 75) don't update automatically.

**Likely cause**: Missing React Query cache invalidation after mutations

**Recommended fix**:
1. Find all mutation hooks (createItem, updateItem, etc.)
2. Add `queryClient.invalidateQueries(['pmItems'])` in `onSuccess` callbacks
3. Ensure dashboard uses the same query key

**Files to check**:
- `client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- Any tRPC mutation hooks that modify PM items

---

### BUG #6: Kanban Page Not Implemented ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Severity**: Medium  
**Impact**: UI shows Kanban tab but clicking it results in 404 error

**Current behavior**: 
- Dashboard shows "Kanban" tab in bottom navigation
- Clicking tab navigates to `/kanban`
- Returns 404 "Page Not Found" error

**Recommended fix**:
**Option 1** (Quick): Remove Kanban tab from UI until implemented
**Option 2** (Better): Implement basic Kanban board view
- Create `client/src/pages/Kanban.tsx`
- Add route to router configuration
- Display PM items in columns by status (Inbox, Backlog, Planned, In Progress, Completed)
- Add drag-and-drop functionality (optional)

---

### BUG #7: GitHub Links Generate Incorrect Paths ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Severity**: Medium  
**Impact**: "View on GitHub" links result in 404 errors

**Current behavior**: Clicking "View on GitHub" for a feature generates URL like:
```
https://github.com/EvanTenenbaum/TERP/tree/main//TERP/client/src/pages/Dashboard&Homepage.tsx
```

**Issues**:
1. Double slash `//` in path
2. Extra `TERP/` prefix (should be just `client/src/pages/...`)
3. Filename has `&` character (may need URL encoding)
4. Filename doesn't match actual file naming convention

**Recommended fix**:
1. Find GitHub URL generation logic (likely in Features.tsx or a utility function)
2. Remove extra `TERP/` prefix
3. Fix double slash issue
4. URL-encode special characters
5. Ensure filename matches actual repository structure

## Deployment Notes

### Current Status
- Running in Manus development environment
- Dev server on port 3000
- Preview URL: https://3000-id66rf050m9nb550luy4d-1adeaea7.manusvm.computer

### Build Issues
- Build completes successfully but takes ~18 seconds
- Vendor chunk is 11MB (very large)
- Checkpoint save fails due to memory constraints during build
- **Recommendation**: Implement further code splitting to reduce vendor chunk size

### Performance Optimization Needed
The build warnings indicate:
```
(!) Some chunks are larger than 600 kB after minification.
vendor-B0Cg4aSI.js: 11,305.30 kB (gzipped: 2,239.52 kB)
```

**Recommendations**:
1. Use dynamic `import()` for heavy dependencies (Mermaid, KaTeX)
2. Implement route-based code splitting
3. Consider lazy loading for non-critical features
4. Review and remove unused dependencies
