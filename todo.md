## DigitalOcean Deployment Fixes (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Fix missing VITE_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT env var in index.html
- [ ] Fix missing VITE_ANALYTICS_WEBSITE_ID env var in index.html
- [ ] Fix unresolved '../trpc' import paths in multiple files
- [ ] Optimize large chunks (index-CfN_uFB5.js is 1.9MB, should be <500kb)
- [ ] Implement code splitting for large dependencies
- [ ] Test deployment build succeeds without errors
- [x] Fix missing VITE_ANALYTICS env vars - made conditional to prevent build errors
- [x] Verify trpc import paths - all correct, using @/lib/trpc
- [x] Implement code splitting - vendor chunks separated (react, trpc, ui, mermaid)
- [ ] REMAINING: vendor chunk still 11MB (needs further optimization but not blocking)
