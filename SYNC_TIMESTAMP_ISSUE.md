# Sync Timestamp Issue

## Current Display
"Last synced: 10/30/2025, 12:36:16 AM (0 items)"

## Problems
1. Date shows 10/30/2025 (future date - should be 2024 or current year)
2. Shows "0 items" which seems incorrect given 68 total items in system
3. Timestamp appears to be hardcoded or using wrong data source

## Investigation Needed
- Check Dashboard.tsx for sync timestamp source
- Verify GitHub sync mutation updates timestamp correctly
- Check if timestamp is stored in database or localStorage
- Verify item count calculation logic
