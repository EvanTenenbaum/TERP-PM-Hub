## 5. Implementation Queue - Autonomous Development

**Location:** `/queue`

**What it does:** Structured queue of features ready for AI agent implementation with watchdog system preventing stalls.

**How to use:**

### Adding to Queue:
1. From Inbox: Click "Add to Queue" on any item
2. AI performs deep analysis:
   - Technical diagnosis (what needs to be built)
   - 10-step implementation plan
   - QA requirements
   - Dependency detection
   - Time estimate (hours)
   - Priority score (1-100)
3. Item appears in Queue with all details

### Starting Implementation:
1. Go to `/queue`
2. Review queued items (sorted by priority)
3. Click "Start Implementation" on desired item
4. Prompt copied to clipboard with:
   - Full context and requirements
   - Progress tracking instructions
   - Anti-stopping directives
   - Watchdog breadcrumb system
5. Paste into new Manus agent chat
6. Agent implements with automatic continuation if timeout

### Watchdog System (Anti-Stall):
- Agent writes progress to `/tmp/progress-[ID].txt` every 5-10 min
- Continuation agent auto-scheduled 65 min after start
- If original times out, continuation picks up from last breadcrumb
- If original completes, continuation exits gracefully
- **Result:** 90% autonomous completion (60% original + 30% continuation)

**Stop Conditions:**
- Set time limit (e.g., 4 hours)
- Set cost limit (e.g., $50 in LLM tokens)
- Set task count (e.g., complete 5 features)
- System auto-stops when limit reached

## 11. Troubleshooting

### "Sync shows 0 items"
- Database migration may have cleared data
- Click Sync button to re-import from GitHub
- Check GitHub repo has `/product-management/` folder

### "Convert to PRD not working"
- Ensure item is type IDEA
- Check LLM API key is configured
- Try refreshing page

### "Agent stopped mid-implementation"
- This is normal - watchdog will continue automatically
- Check `/tmp/progress-[ID].txt` for last breadcrumb
- Continuation agent spawns after 65 minutes

### "Client feedback not showing"
- Verify item has 'client-feedback' tag
- Check `/feedback` page directly
- Refresh Dashboard to update count

---

## 12. Advanced Features

### Batch Implementation:
1. Select multiple queue items
2. Set stop condition (time/cost/count)
3. System generates master plan
4. Implements in priority order
5. Auto-stops at limit

### Impact Analysis:
- AI detects when new feature affects existing code
- Suggests backend/frontend/database changes needed
- Highlights potential conflicts

### Smart Roadmap Placement:
- AI analyzes dependencies
- Suggests optimal order
- Auto-reorganizes when priorities change
