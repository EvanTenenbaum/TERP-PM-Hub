## ‚úÖ FIXED: AI Agent Response Rendering

**Location:** `/chat/inbox` (Idea Inbox Agent)

**Problem (RESOLVED):**
- AI agent was returning raw JSON instead of formatted markdown
- Response showed: `{ "type": "IDEA", "title": "...", "response": "..." }`
- Expected: User-friendly formatted response

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `/home/ubuntu/terp-pm-hub/server/routers.ts` line 253-280
- Now extracts `response` field from JSON for inbox agent
- Saves user-friendly message to database instead of raw JSON
- Background PM item creation still works correctly
- Streamdown component renders markdown properly

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Sent test message: "Add a dark mode toggle to the dashboard"
- ‚úÖ Received formatted response: "Got it! I've captured this as an IDEA for a dark mode toggle on the dashboard. This would be a great enhancement for user experience."
- ‚úÖ No raw JSON displayed
- ‚úÖ Markdown rendering works
- ‚úÖ PM item created in database (visible in dashboard inbox)

**Status:** PRODUCTION READY

## Bible Compliance Notes

**Production-Ready Standard Violated:**
- ‚ùå "Real interactions for every UI element" - chat shows raw JSON
- ‚ùå "User-friendly error messages" - no indication this is wrong
- ‚ùå "Visual Polish" - unprofessional JSON display

**Must Fix Before Checkpoint:**
- Cannot save checkpoint with this critical UX issue
- Violates "Never deliver broken states" protocol
- Must reach production-ready status first


## ‚úÖ VERIFIED: Feature Planning Agent

**Test Date:** October 29, 2025

**Test Query:** "Help me write a PRD for the batch import inventory feature"

**Result:** ‚úÖ PASS
- Response rendered properly with markdown formatting
- Bullet points, numbered lists, and paragraphs all display correctly
- Streamdown component working as expected
- No raw JSON or formatting issues
- Professional, contextual response following TERP Bible protocols
- Asked clarifying questions before proceeding (good PM practice)

**Conclusion:** Feature Planning agent is production-ready. No structured output needed for this agent type.
