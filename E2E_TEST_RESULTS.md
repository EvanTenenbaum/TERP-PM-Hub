# End-to-End QA Test Results

## Test Session: 2025-10-30 03:22 AM

### Dashboard Status
- ✅ Quick Capture visible and functional
- ✅ Stats cards showing: 60 Features, 6 Ideas, 2 Bugs, 72 Total, 2 Client Feedback
- ✅ Inbox section showing 14 recent items
- ❌ **BUG**: Sync timestamp shows "10/30/2025, 7:14:04 AM (0 items)" - wrong year and 0 items despite having 72 items
- ✅ Client Feedback card visible with "View All" link

### Test 1: Quick Capture → Inbox
**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** (with UI refresh issue)

**Steps**:
1. Entered test idea: "Add webhook integration for external PM tools like Linear and Jira"
2. Clicked "Capture" button
3. Toast notification appeared: "Idea captured! The AI is processing it..."
4. Waited 8 seconds for AI processing
5. Checked Inbox page

**Results**:
- ✅ Item was successfully created in database: `TERP-FEAT-1761808961576: Webhook Integration for External PM Tools`
- ✅ AI correctly classified it as FEAT (feature) instead of IDEA
- ✅ Database shows correct timestamp: `Thu Oct 30 2025 07:22:42 GMT-0400`
- ❌ **BUG #2**: Item does NOT appear in Inbox UI even after manual page refresh
- ❌ **BUG #3**: Dashboard stats did not update (still shows 60 Features, should be 61)

**Root Cause of BUG #2**: 
- AI classified the item as type "FEAT" (feature)
- Inbox page filters only show types: IDEA, BUG, IMPROVE (line 71-73 of Inbox.tsx)
- FEAT items are excluded from Inbox view by design
- This is a **workflow issue**, not a bug - FEAT items should go to Features page, not Inbox

**Conclusion**: Backend functionality works perfectly (AI triage, database insert). The item is correctly classified as FEAT and appears in the Features list, not the Inbox. This is expected behavior.

**Additional Finding - BUG #4 (FIXED)**: 
- Search functionality in Features page was NOT implemented
- ✅ **FIXED**: Added filter logic to Features.tsx (lines 232-245)
- ✅ Search now works correctly - filtering by title, itemId, and description
- ✅ Status filter also implemented
- ✅ **VERIFIED**: Searching "webhook" now shows only the webhook integration item
- Item details: `TERP-FEAT-1761808961576: Webhook Integration for External PM Tools`
- Full description visible: "Implement webhook functionality to allow seamless integration with external Project Management tools such as Linear and Jira..."

### Test 2: Convert to PRD
**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** (After fixing timeout issue)

**Initial Problem**:
- Button showed "Generating PRD..." indefinitely
- No timeout or error handling in LLM calls

**Fix Applied**:
- Added 30-second timeout to both draft and enhancement LLM calls
- Added try-catch error handling with detailed logging
- Added console.log statements to track progress

**Test Results**:
1. Clicked "Convert to PRD" on "Dark Mode Toggle for Dashboard" (IDEA type)
2. Button showed "Generating PRD..." loading state
3. After ~35 seconds, item disappeared from Inbox
4. ✅ Item converted from IDEA → FEAT type
5. ✅ Status changed from inbox → backlog
6. ✅ Item now appears in Features page with FEAT badge and backlog status
7. ✅ Full PRD generated with comprehensive sections:
   - Product Requirements Document with Overview
   - User Stories (5 detailed stories)
   - Functional Requirements (FR1.1 through FR1.6)
   - Non-Functional Requirements (NFR2.1 through NFR2.6)
   - Technical Approach with styling strategy
   - Theme Application details
   - State Management approach

**Conclusion**: Convert to PRD feature working perfectly after timeout fix

- ⏸️ Test 3: Add to Implementation Queue (NOT STARTED)
- ⏸️ Test 4: Client Feedback Portal (NOT STARTED)
- ⏸️ Test 5: Dashboard Features (NOT STARTED)

### Bugs Found: 4

**BUG #1 - SYNC TIMESTAMP (Critical)**
- Sync timestamp shows wrong year: "10/30/2025" instead of "10/30/2024"
- Shows "0 items" despite having 72 items in database
- Likely issue with github_sync table or date formatting

**BUG #2 - NOT A BUG (Workflow Design)**
- Quick Capture items classified as FEAT don't appear in Inbox
- This is by design: Inbox only shows IDEA, BUG, IMPROVE types
- FEAT items appear in Features page
- Working as intended

**BUG #3 - DASHBOARD STATS NOT UPDATING (Medium)**
- Dashboard stats cards do not update after new items created
- Shows 60 Features even after creating FEAT item (should be 61)
- Requires manual page refresh to see updated counts
- Missing React Query invalidation or auto-refresh logic

**BUG #4 - SEARCH NOT WORKING (FIXED)**
- Search functionality in Features page was not implemented
- ✅ FIXED: Added filter logic to Features.tsx
- Now works correctly for title, itemId, and description search
- Status filter also implemented

**BUG #5 - CONVERT TO PRD HANGS (Critical - Blocking)**
- "Convert to PRD" button shows "Generating PRD..." indefinitely
- No error messages, no completion, no timeout
- Blocks testing of entire PRD workflow
- Needs urgent investigation and fix

### Self-Healed Issues: 1
- ✅ BUG #4: Search functionality implemented during testing

### Remaining Critical Issues: 2
1. BUG #1: Sync timestamp showing wrong data
2. BUG #5: Convert to PRD infinite loading

### Next Steps:
1. **Fix BUG #5** (Convert to PRD hanging) - add error handling, timeout, and logging
2. **Fix BUG #1** (Sync timestamp) - investigate github_sync table and date logic
3. **Fix BUG #3** (Dashboard stats) - add React Query invalidation after mutations
4. **Resume E2E testing** once critical bugs are fixed
5. Test Implementation Queue workflow
6. Test Client Feedback Portal
7. Test Dashboard features
8. Test Watchdog system (if possible)

### Test Environment:
- Date: 2025-10-30 03:22 AM
- Dev server: Running with no TypeScript errors
- Database: 73 PM items total (60 FEAT, 6 IDEA, 2 BUG, 5 IMPROVE)
- Browser: Chromium (latest)


### Test 3: Add to Implementation Queue
**Status**: ✅ **PASSED**

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigated to Inbox page
2. Clicked "Add to Queue" on "Upgrade Training Docs with Annotated Screenshot User Flows" item
3. Button showed "Adding..." loading state
4. After ~10 seconds, button returned to "Add to Queue"

**Verification**:
1. ✅ Navigated to `/queue` page successfully
2. ✅ Queue shows 3 items total with 4h 30m estimated time
3. ✅ Item appears in queue with:
   - Title: "Upgrade Training Docs with Annotated Screenshot User Flows"
   - Priority: high
   - Status: queued
   - Estimated time: 90 min
   - AI-generated diagnosis (comprehensive analysis)
   - Implementation steps (10 detailed steps)
   - QA requirements (comprehensive test scenarios)

**Database Verification**:
Checked `implementationQueue` table and confirmed entries include:
- `pmItemId`: Original item ID
- `title`, `description`: Copied from PM item
- `diagnosis`: AI-generated problem analysis
- `priority`: high/medium/low
- `estimatedMinutes`: Time estimate
- `dependencies`: JSON array
- `qaRequirements`: Detailed test scenarios
- `implementationSteps`: JSON array of steps
- `status`: queued/in-progress/completed
- `queueOrder`: Position in queue

**Conclusion**: Add to Queue feature working perfectly with comprehensive AI analysis


### Test 4: Kanban Board View
**Status**: ❌ **FAILED** - Page does not exist

**Test Steps**:
1. Attempted to navigate to `/kanban` URL

**Result**:
- 404 Page Not Found error
- "Sorry, the page you are looking for doesn't exist. It may have been moved or deleted."

**Investigation**:
The Kanban tab appears in the Dashboard UI, but the route is not implemented.

**Conclusion**: Kanban board feature is not implemented - needs to be added to routing


### Test 5: GitHub Integration
**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL FAIL** - Links generated but paths are incorrect

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigated to Features page
2. Clicked "View on GitHub" link for "Dashboard & Homepage" feature (TERP-FEAT-001)

**Result**:
- ✅ Link successfully navigated to GitHub repository (EvanTenenbaum/TERP)
- ❌ 404 error: "The main branch of TERP does not contain the path TERP/client/src/pages/Dashboard&Homepage.tsx"

**Investigation**:
The generated GitHub URL is:
```
https://github.com/EvanTenenbaum/TERP/tree/main//TERP/client/src/pages/Dashboard&Homepage.tsx
```

**Issues Found**:
1. Double slash `//` in path
2. Extra `TERP/` prefix (should be just `client/src/pages/...`)
3. Filename has `&` character which may need URL encoding
4. Filename format doesn't match actual file naming convention (should be kebab-case or PascalCase .tsx)

**Conclusion**: GitHub integration is implemented but URL generation logic needs fixing
