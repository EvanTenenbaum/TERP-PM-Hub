## Quality Standards Checklist (Per Bible)

### Production-Ready Code Standard

**Absolute Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ NO placeholders or stubs allowed
- ‚úÖ Complete, functional, production-ready code only
- ‚úÖ Real interactions for every UI element
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling and loading states
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Must verify: Every button does something real

### Testing Protocol

Following Bible Section: "System-Wide Validation (After Changes)"

#### 1. Navigation Flows Test
- [ ] Click through all navigation links
- [ ] Verify no broken routes or 404 errors
- [ ] Test back/forward browser navigation
- [ ] Test all sidebar/header navigation items

#### 2. Data Flows Verification
- [ ] Check that PM data renders correctly
- [ ] Ensure data transformations work as expected
- [ ] Validate all UI components receive correct props
- [ ] Verify GitHub sync populates database

#### 3. Visual Regression Check
- [ ] Verify all pages render correctly
- [ ] Check responsive behavior (mobile 320px+, tablet 768px+, desktop 1024px+)
- [ ] Ensure no layout breaks or styling regressions
- [ ] Test all interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled)

#### 4. Browser Testing
- [ ] Test in actual browser, not just TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Verify all async operations complete
- [ ] Check console for errors
- [ ] Test loading states and error handling
